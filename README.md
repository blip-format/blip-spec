# BLIP Specification (`blip-spec`)

**Welcome to the official specification for the BLIP animated image format!**

---

## What is BLIP?

**BLIP** is a modern, efficient, and unambiguous format for short, looping, muted animated images. Designed as a drop-in replacement for animated GIFs, `.blip` files offer dramatically better compression and quality by using next-generation video codecs, while retaining the intuitive, in-line behavior and cultural cachet of GIFs.

## Key Features

- **Infinitely Looping:** Every `.blip` file is a looping animation by design.
- **Autoplay & Muted:** Blips are always silent and start playing automatically‚Äîno audio, no controls.
- **Short & Sweet:** Ideal for memes, reactions, stickers, UI animations, and more.
- **Modern Compression:** Uses efficient video encoding (e.g., AV1), offering far smaller file sizes and better image quality than GIF.
- **Optional Transparency:** Full alpha channel support for crisp, modern visuals.
- **Clear Semantics:** The `.blip` extension and MIME type (`image/blip`) make usage and intent unambiguous.

## Why BLIP?

- **GIF is outdated.** BLIP is the 21st-century answer: smaller files, smoother playback, better colors.
- **One purpose.** BLIP isn‚Äôt a generic video. It's purpose is for short, looping, in-line animations.
